I'm a Rutgers University Computer Science graduate with a passion for software development, Cloud Infrastructure and DevOps. I have a working proficiency in languages like Python, C, C++, Java, and JavaScript. Alongside these, I've also gained hands-on experience in various frameworks and tools that span web platforms crafted with Django and Flask, user interfaces designed using React, and backend solutions implemented with Node.js. Along with development, I'm well-versed in leveraging CI/CD tools, including Azure DevOps, Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes, to streamline and optimize deployment processes. My forte lies in harnessing the power of cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, where I've successfully migrated and transformed legacy infrastructures.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
 In recognition of my academic achievements and contributions, I was honored with both the Chancellor's Merit Scholarship and the Dean's Meritorious Scholarship, which significantly supported my graduate studies at Rutgers. Further deepening my engagement with academia, I had the privilege to assist Professor Iman Dehzangi as a Teaching Assistant for courses on C and Unix, as well as Operating Systems.
 </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
 Throughout my academic journey, leadership has been a defining aspect of my experience. During my undergraduate studies, I held the esteemed position of Head of the Student Organization. This leadership trajectory continued in my graduate years, where I served as the Vice President of the Graduate School Student Association at Rutgers University.
 </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Beyond my professional pursuits, I have a keen interest in staying updated with current news, geopolitics, and delving into the nuances of the stock markets. Outside of the digital world, I find joy in cycling and exploring city streets. Should we connect, I'd be thrilled to share a ride and a fresh perspective on both tech and the world around us.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Feel free to connect with me on social media or delve deeper into my journey by switching tabs. I'd love for you to know more about who I am and what drives me.
