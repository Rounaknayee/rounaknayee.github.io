I'm Rounak Nayee, a Computer Science graduate from Rutgers University, specialized in the intersection of software development and DevOps. With a foundation in languages like C, C++, Java, and Python, I have an affinity for the complete software lifecycle. My expertise shines in cloud platforms, notably AWS and Azure, having transitioned infrastructures from physical data centers to the cloud efficiently.

Automation is my mantra. From crafting AWS Lambda Functions to using Terraform for infrastructure-as-code, I aim for streamlined operations. My role as a Cloud Software Engineer Intern at New Jersey Transit saw me enhancing scalability and optimizing processes.
