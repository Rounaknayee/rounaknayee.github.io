<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am currently a dedicated MS Computer Science student at Rutgers University, with a rich background from graduating with a BTech in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar. Having ranked 701 in India for my entrance into IIT, my journey underscores a strong foundation in machine learning, data science, and advanced programming techniques. My expertise particularly shines in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), alongside strong capabilities in React and Node.js for web development. These skills enable me to address complex problems innovatively. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
 Working as a graduate research assistant under Professor Dehzangi, I contribute to projects that deepen my knowledge and application of NLP and ML, enhancing both my academic journey and the fields at large. This role allows me to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and their practical applications, honing my research and development skills.

 </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
 My project work includes developing a sentiment analysis-based email prioritization add-on, authoring the "ComicBot" research paper to showcase my NLP skills, and implementing a multi-threaded web crawler. Additionally, I've created a modern e-commerce website and a server-client model for a Twitter-like platform, demonstrating my full-stack development expertise using React, Node.js, and AWS.

 </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Beyond my professional pursuits, I have a keen interest in staying updated with current news, geopolitics, and delving into the nuances of the stock markets. Outside of the digital world, I find joy in cycling and exploring city streets. Should we connect, I'd be thrilled to share a ride and a fresh perspective on both tech and the world around us.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Feel free to reach out to discuss how my comprehensive background in ML, NLP, and web development, coupled with my academic achievements and project experiences, can be an asset to your team or project. I am keen to collaborate on initiatives that benefit from my technical skills and innovative approach.
